# LinkedIn-Jobs-Analysis

Every day, thousands of companies and individuals turn to LinkedIn in search of talent. This dataset contains a nearly comprehensive record of 33,000+ job postings listed over the course of 2 days, months apart. Each individual posting contains 27 valuable attributes, including the title, job description, salary, location, application URL, and work-types (remote, contract, etc), in addition to separate files containing the benefits, skills, and industries associated with each posting. The majority of jobs are also linked to a company, which are all listed in another csv file containing attributes such as the company description, headquarters location, and number of employees, and follower count.
